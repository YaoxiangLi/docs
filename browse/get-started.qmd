title: "A catalogue of R packages"

R-universe can be your entry point to many R packages.
R-universe is a collection of universes, each of them featuring the packages of a team or individual.

You can search packages, and assess them thanks to all the information provided on universe and package pages.
Find out more about the three levels of navigation in R-universe:

- [searching the entire R ecosystem](/browse/search.html)
- [browsing work from a maintainer or organization](/browse/universes.html)
- [individual package information](/browse/packages.html)

:::{.callout-caution}
R-universe does not vet packages: it is an open publishing system. 
The system builds and deploys R packages from Git repositories into installation repositories. 
The owner of the universe is responsible for their own policies and quality control.
