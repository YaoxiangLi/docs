title: "RSS feeds of package updates"
---

The /feed.xml endpoint on any R-universe domain gives an RSS feed of recent R package updates in the repository:

- https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/feed.xml
- https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev/feed.xml
- https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/feed.xml

Each feed item contains the name and version of the updated R package, along with a timestamp and a link to the build log of the most recent commit. 
The feed also contains some additional metadata such as the package description, and a list of the articles (vignettes) contained in the package.


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
url <- "https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/feed.xml"
xml <- xml2::read_xml(url)
remove_space <- function(node) {
  xml2::xml_text(node) <-
    gsub("\\\n", " ", xml2::xml_text(node))
}
descs <- xml2::xml_find_all(xml, ".//description")
purrr::walk(descs, remove_space)

xml <- xml |> 
  as.character()
sprintf("
  <details>
  <summary>Example (%s)</summary>
  %s
</details>
", url, xml) |> cat()
```

The dashboard for any universe also includes a link to this same URL, such that users can easily find and subscribe to your feed.
