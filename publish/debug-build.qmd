## Is it possible to customize the package build process with custom options/tools/variables?

No, that is not possible. 
Think of R-universe more like your own mini-CRAN. 
The build environment is actually very similar to that of CRAN, if the package can build on CRAN, it will probably work on R-universe.

This is on purpose: we want to make sure that the packages deployed on R-universe are reproducible and will work on the user machine as well, and do not depend on some hidden settings or tools.

## How to publish vignettes/articles which require custom software/tokens to render?

The best solution is to precompute these vignettes on your local machine, see: [How to precompute package vignettes or pkgdown articles](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/)


## Are packages on r-universe required to pass CMD check or meet other criteria?

No. 
R-universe is an open publishing system. 
The system just builds and deploys R packages from git into personal cran-like repositories. 
The owner of the universe is responsible for their own policies and quality control.
