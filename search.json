For example, the packages and information from rOpenSci can be found on https://ropensci.r-universe.dev, and packages maintained by me are listed at https://jeroen.r-universe.dev (note how these two sets overlap).\nThe top tabs allow you to explore different resources within universe. The builds tab shows the current state of the repository: a table with the name and version of each package, including the commit date, author, and build status. Clicking on the package name in the table sends you to the homepage of the package (more on this below), and the maintainer name links to the subdomain of that maintainer, listing other projects maintained by this person.\nThe packages tab lists descriptive information from all packages in the repository, and the articles tab shows all documents (e.g. vignettes). The contributors tab shows a chart with contributor statistics for the organization or maintainer. Clicking on the a bar in the chart sends you to this other universe where you can explore more work by this person.\nThe same subdomain hosts the actual cran-like package repository for this user or organization. Hence in order to list or install packages from rOpenSci in R, you would use:\n# List available packages\navailable.packages(repos = \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\")\n\n# Install a package\ninstall.packages(\"magick\", repos = \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\")"

The badges underneath show statistics about the package, such as dependencies, reverse dependencies, and GitHub stars. Clicking on the ’exports’ badge will show all functions and datasets exported by the package, which link to the respective sections in the manual page. If specified, we also show how the package should be cited in papers.\n\nHow are the dependencies / dependents calculated?\nBoth are calculated using transitive (recursive) strong dependencies, hence this includes both direct and indirect dependencies. Or in practical terms: other packages that need to be installed at minimum to be able to use the target package.\nAt package build time, we use tools::package_dependencies(pkg, recursive = TRUE) to derive the list of hard dependencies and store this in the database. R-base packages are not included. The dependencies value is simply the size of this list. The dependents value is the opposite: this is the number of packages in R-universe which list the target package as one of its dependencies."

    "text": "All the documentation\nTo let you start using packages as quickly as possible, r-universe renders all available documentation and presents this as clear and concisely as possible on the homepage.\nMost R packages have 3 forms of documentation: a readme file, a reference manual (help pages), and a number of articles (vignettes). These articles are often a good place to get started, and are listed on the package homepage right under the descriptives. From here you can view both the rendered html/pdf document, as well as the rmarkdown source file used to (re)produce the article.\nFurther down the page you can see the content from the package readme. Most packages these days include a README.md file which can nicely be rendered into HTML.\nAfter the readme follows a section named “reference manual” containing a table with all the help pages. These link to the respective chapters in the html reference manual2, which provide the most extensive documentation for each function in the package, including descriptions, parameters, examples, etc. Screenshot of a chapter in the HTML reference manual for a package, showing descriptions, parameters, and examples for a function.\n\ncran.dev shortlinks\nOn r-universe you can find package repositories from many different organizations and maintainers. But sometimes you just want to lookup a particular CRAN package, without knowing the developer. The cran.dev shortlink service lets you navigate or link directly to the r-universe homepage and docs of any established CRAN package.\nThe root domain https://cran.dev/{package} redirects to the primary homepage for a package:\n\nhttps://cran.dev/magick\nhttps://cran.dev/Matrix\nhttps://cran.dev/ggplot2\n\nThe subdomain https://docs.cran.dev/{package} redirects to package manual page:\n\nhttps://docs.cran.dev/targets\nhttps://docs.cran.dev/MASS\nhttps://docs.cran.dev/Rcpp\n\nFinally the subdomain https://api.cran.dev/{package} does not redirect, but returns a JSON blob with links to the package versions and resources. For example:\n\nhttps://api.cran.dev/gert\n\nThis shows the package page and maintainer for the gert package, and information on both the current CRAN release and development versions. Right now it returns:\n{\n  \"package\": \"gert\",\n  \"maintainer\": \"Jeroen Ooms &lt;jeroen@berkeley.edu&gt;\",\n  \"home\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/gert\",\n  \"release\": {\n    \"version\": \"1.9.2\",\n    \"date\": \"2023-06-30T08:43:26.000Z\",\n    \"source\": \"https://github.com/cran/gert\",\n    \"repository\": \"https://cloud.r-project.org\",\n    \"docs\": \"https://cran.r-universe.dev/gert/doc/manual.html\",\n    \"api\": \"https://cran.r-universe.dev/api/packages/gert\"\n  },\n  \"devel\": {\n    \"version\": \"1.9000\",\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-20T11:08:09.000Z\",\n    \"source\": \"https://github.com/r-lib/gert\",\n    \"repository\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\",\n    \"docs\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/gert/doc/manual.html\",\n    \"api\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/api/packages/gert\"\n  }\n}\nWe can see the release and devel version of this package, with links to the respective sources, cranlike repository, manual, and package metadata.\nFrom the above it can be seen that the gert r-universe page is https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/gert and the r-universe \"repository\" from where to install the devel version of gert:\n# install 'devel' gert\ninstall.packages(\"gert\", repos = \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\")\nThe \"api\" field shows the JSON url with all the information and metadata about this package:\n# Everything there is to know about devel gert\ngert &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON('https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/api/packages/gert')\nNote that not all packages have a devel version available. CRAN packages that are not found GitHub or GitLab or r-forge only have a release version, for example: https://api.cran.dev/MASS"
