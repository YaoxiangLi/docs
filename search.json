    "text": "Each user and organization in r-universe has a unique subdomain under r-universe.dev with a package repository from where packages can directly be installed. For example, the packages and information from rOpenSci can be found on https://ropensci.r-universe.dev, and packages maintained by me are listed at https://jeroen.r-universe.dev (note how these two sets overlap).\nThe top tabs allow you to explore different resources within universe. The builds tab shows the current state of the repository: a table with the name and version of each package, including the commit date, author, and build status. Clicking on the package name in the table sends you to the homepage of the package (more on this below), and the maintainer name links to the subdomain of that maintainer, listing other projects maintained by this person.\nThe packages tab lists descriptive information from all packages in the repository, and the articles tab shows all documents (e.g. vignettes). The contributors tab shows a chart with contributor statistics for the organization or maintainer. Clicking on the a bar in the chart sends you to this other universe where you can explore more work by this person.\nThe same subdomain hosts the actual cran-like package repository for this user or organization. Hence in order to list or install packages from rOpenSci in R, you would use:\n# List available packages\navailable.packages(repos = \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\")\n\n# Install a package\ninstall.packages(\"magick\", repos = \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\")"

The badges underneath show statistics about the package, such as dependencies, reverse dependencies, and GitHub stars. Clicking on the ’exports’ badge will show all functions and datasets exported by the package, which link to the respective sections in the manual page.

These articles are often a good place to get started, and are listed on the package homepage right under the descriptives. From here you can view both the rendered html/pdf document, as well as the rmarkdown source file used to (re)produce the article.\nFurther down the page you can see the content from the package readme. Most packages these days include a README.md file which can nicely be rendered into HTML.\nAfter the readme follows a section named “reference manual” containing a table with all the help pages. These link to the respective chapters in the html reference manual2, which provide the most extensive documentation for each function in the package, including descriptions, parameters, examples, etc. Screenshot of a chapter in the HTML reference manual for a package, showing descriptions, parameters, and examples for a function."

Finally the section “usage by other packages” shows other packages on r-universe depending on this package, grouped by owner.
