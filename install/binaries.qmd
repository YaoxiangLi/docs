## Does R-universe have Linux binaries?

Yes, but right now we only provide binaries for a single linux target: `r-release` on `ubuntu:latest`. This is the platform that the R-universe build system itself runs via the [base-image](https://github.com/r-universe-org/base-image), and we use these binaries when installing dependencies of a package.


To use these binaries on Linux you need to add the corresponding repository to your `repos`. It is not needed to set a custom user agent. For example for the `jeroen` universe:

```r
options(repos = c(
  linux = 'https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/bin/linux/noble/4.4/',
  sources = 'https://jeroen.r-universe.dev',
  cran = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'
))
```

See how [this is done automatically in the base image](https://github.com/r-universe-org/base-image/blob/f20ec9fc6f51ef8a89aad489206a43790bd9bf77/Rprofile#L10-L16) when an environment variable `MY_UNIVERSE` is set.

## How to use WebAssembly Binaries

We have experimental support for webassembly binaries! You should use the official [r-wasm repository](https://repo.r-wasm.org) for dependencies. For example to install the dev version of dplyr:

```r
install.packages('dplyr',
  repos = c('https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://repo.r-wasm.org'))
```
